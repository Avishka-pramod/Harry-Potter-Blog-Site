            Fake galleons are coins made of gold, silver, and bronze. They are
            typically round with a square-shaped hole in the center. The
            currency is embossed with a magical crest that features the Hogwarts
            crest, a griffon, and a lion. The coins usually have a value of one
            galleon and can be used to purchase items in the wizarding world.
            They are also used to fund magical activities, such as the Triwizard
            Tournament.

            The Deluminator is a magical device invented by Albus Dumbledore
            which is a pocket-sized device that looks like a cigarette lighter.
            It has the power to remove, store, and return light. When activated,
            it will take the light from any nearby source, such as a lamp post,
            and store it inside its reservoir. The stored light can then be used
            to light any desired area. It is a powerful tool that can be used to
            bring light to dark places, confuse pursuers, and create
            distractions.

            In the Harry Potter series, an Invisibility Cloak is an enchanted
            garment that renders its wearer completely invisible. The cloak is
            made of a special fabric that is extremely difficult to detect or
            catch hold of, and is said to be made of an enchanted material
            similar to silk, although the exact fabric remains a mystery. The
            Cloak has a silver-ish sheen and is decorated with various symbols
            and designs, such as stars, moons, and the Hogwarts crest. The Cloak
            is virtually indestructible and can only be pierced by certain
            objects and spells.

            The Resurrection Stone is a powerful magical object that was one of
            the Deathly Hallows. It was a stone with a mysterious origin, and
            was said to have the power to bring the dead back to life. The stone
            was supposedly found in the depths of the forest, and was said to be
            part of a powerful wand that belonged to Death himself. It was one
            of the three objects considered to be the Deathly Hallows. The other
            two were the Elder Wand and the Cloak of Invisibility. The stone was
            a pale, milky-white color, with a strange power that could be felt
            emanating from it. It was rumored to be able to bring the dead back
            to life, but it was also said to come with a heavy cost.
